# product-rating-app-spring
A Java Spring Boot application that lets users rate different food and drink items.
# Story behind the app
I have always loved rating things, I think it is interesting to try to rate products by different criteria, and then compare that  rating with other people's ratings. It's a good way to understand ourselves, our needs and the products we are rating.
# Technical specs
The app uses a Microsoft SQL Server database, Spring for the backend and Thymeleaf as the frontend engine.
# Functionality
Every product has a brand, is a drink or a food item, belongs to a category and has different flavours.
Every product can be rated by different people on a scale from 1 to 10 in term of flavour and smell, and an additional remark can also be given.
